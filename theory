All types of Algorithms 



1) Brute Force algoritm:

  This is the most basic and simplest type of algorithm. A Brute Force Algorithm is the straightforward approach to a problem i.e., the first approach that comes to 
  our mind on seeing the problem. More technically it is just like iterating every possibility available to solve that problem.

  Example: 

  If there is a lock of 4-digit PIN. The digits to be chosen from 0-9 then the brute force will be trying all possible combinations one by one like 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 
  and so on until we get the right PIN. In the worst case, it will take 10,000 tries to find the right combination.
